                    It saves you time. If you spend a lot of your time answering emails or social media queries, an FAQ can be a real timesaver. It can also help prevent costly and time-consuming returns in your online store.
                    It brings new website traffic and new customers. Google’s goal is to deliver answers to questions. If you put your text in a Q&A format, you’re doing half the work already. Even better, if you have a good answer to a question, you might get featured in one of Google’s answer boxes or feature snippets, which will give you a big traffic boost.
                    It builds trust and shows that you get it: A well-written FAQ page shows experience. You know what customers are thinking and you’ve already got an answer. It’s a great way to increase the trust and professionalism of your website.

                <p className='px-8'>
                    The first is pretty obvious: What do your customers ask you? Look at your email inbox or social media account and see which questions keep popping up. What usually makes people hesitate before purchasing? What doubts might they have? The more you can automate the answers to these questions, these easier you’ll make it for your customers to buy with confidence. And you’ll save yourself time too.
