                    It saves you time. If you spend a lot of your time answering emails or social media queries, an FAQ can be a real timesaver. It can also help prevent costly and time-consuming returns in your online store.
                    It brings new website traffic and new customers. Google’s goal is to deliver answers to questions. If you put your text in a Q&A format, you’re doing half the work already. Even better, if you have a good answer to a question, you might get featured in one of Google’s answer boxes or feature snippets, which will give you a big traffic boost.
                    It builds trust and shows that you get it: A well-written FAQ page shows experience. You know what customers are thinking and you’ve already got an answer. It’s a great way to increase the trust and professionalism of your website.
